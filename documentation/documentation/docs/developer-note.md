## About Me

Hola! I am Emir Husain, the developer behind the **React Firebase Chat App**. I started working on this application with certain vision. On completion, I finally decided to make it open source and let the community to drive it forward. I try to create projects that provide a strong foundation to beginners and make them familiar with specific topic utilized or implemented in a project.

### My Journey

I started my journey as developer few years ago around 2020 and have been working into several domains, including web development, android development and game development. I love contributing to open source by creating projects and guides to help beginners onboard their development journey.

If you believe that there is a better way to implement a functionality then go ahead with it as that will surely server my purpose of building up your interest and mindset to think.
